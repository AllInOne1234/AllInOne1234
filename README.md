# Hello world!
### I believe...
 - Privacy is a right, not a challenge
 - Anybody should be able to learn to code if they WANT TO
 - All code should be respectively credited to the proper authors
 - in a Google-free future
 - making profit off of the good and value you produce, not on luck
#### I hope we share similar passions.


###### I hope you enjoy my projects! ALL PROJECTS ARE MALWARE FREE.

### Currently Working On (Priority Top to Bottom):

 - An HTML how-to file. Will go over what HTML is, the basics, and a list of commonly used tags.
 - Windows Poo, the HTML copycat of a pretty bad windows system.
