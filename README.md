# Hello world!

print("Python")


#### I hope you enjoy my projects! ALL PROJECTS ARE MALWARE FREE UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THE README.md FILE OR IN DESCRIPTION.

### Currently Working On (Priority Top to Bottom):

 - An HTML how-to file. Will go over what HTML is, the basics, and a list of commonly used tags.
 - A website model (search engine, homepage, search results page) and online softwares similar to Microsoft Word and Google Slides. Search engine is very expansive, meaning it will not only search the web, but can also do things to YOUR computer, like creating a new file, opening an application, things like that.
